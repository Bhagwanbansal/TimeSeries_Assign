# RoadDataset-TimeSeriesPrediction
On a road dataset of about 25 kilometres, this project conducts time series prediction.

## Objective-
To provide predictions for each Section's Parameters 9â€“13 based on the provided dataset.

### Methodology Adopted-
By extracting 10th year data for paragraphs 9 through 13 for each part, the data were transformed into a train and test dataset.
Random Forest implementation was done using the Extra Regressor Model, and values were anticipated.
